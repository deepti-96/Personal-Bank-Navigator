# PERSONAL BANK NAVIGATOR

## Introduction

Those who are unfamiliar with a city's financial system may find it difficult to locate a bank. Most individuals who migrate from rural to cities plan to invest or open bank accounts to save their money. Those who are unfamiliar with the world of technology may find it difficult to use sophisticated Applications. There needs to be some kind of link between a city and an outsider that acts as a bridge between the two.<br />
In response, we came up with a solution that involves asking the person for a nearby famous landmark in the city. This system allows the user to take input from the user and display information about the bank, such as the Bank name, address, Weekly schedule of the Bank (in hours), Phone number of the branch, and details about ATMs and deposits machines. By doing so, we can assist people with our proposed system.<br />
In this application, a client-server framework is used to create the terminal-based application.

## Algorithm

Step 1: START<br />
Step 2: Establish a secure connection between the client and server (Enter the correct IP address)<br />
Step 3: Fix errors (if any) while establishing a connection <br />
Step 4: After establishing the connection, ask the (user)client-side to choose <br />
Step 5: Verify whether a choice is valid on the client's side <br />
If (invalid):<br />
Request a valid choice from the user<br />
Else:<br />
The server will be notified of the choice <br />
Step 6: Server Side Receive the choice sent by the client<br />
Step 7: Load the contents of the file associated with the choice into the buffer and send it to the client<br />
Step 8: The user receives the result (as soon as the buffer arrives on the client side)<br />
Step 9: END
